## What?
This is a stopwatch app built by Francesco & Owen of FourLoops ([see our blog here](http://fourloops.github.io/FourLoopsBlog/)) strictly using TDD.

## Why?
In order to time things. And to practise our TDD.

## How?
Using TDD following [this tutorial from dwyl](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-qunit). It will have the following functionality:
* Counter should be at Zero when we start
* Start Counting time from a specific point
* Stop Counting
* Continue Counting (without resetting) pick up where we left off.
* Re-set the counter to Zero.Ëœ
* (Stretch goal): Add 'lap' button to record lap times visually in a list. This will also be cleared by reset button.
